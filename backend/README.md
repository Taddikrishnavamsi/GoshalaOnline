# Backend

This is the backend directory for the GoshalaOnline project.

## Overview

The backend is built using Node.js and Express.js framework to provide API services for the GoshalaOnline application.

## Structure

- `server.js` - Main server file that initializes the Express application
- Additional backend files and modules will be added here as the project grows

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install express
   ```

2. Run the server:
   ```
   node server.js
   ```

3. The server will start on port 3000 (or the port specified in environment variables)

## API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Health check endpoint that returns server status

More endpoints will be added as the application develops.
